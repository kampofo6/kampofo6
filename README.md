### Hey!👋🏿

I'm Kojo! A Software Engineer in Toronto, Canada 🇨🇦.

I currently study Software Development @ Sheridan College . I recently worked at <b>RBC</b> building Python automation tools for GenAI chatbot validation, and have previously gained experience through software engineering internships at <b>Tangerine 🍊</b> and <b>Scotiabank 🏦</b>.

I'm passionate about building large-scale, high-impact products that create meaningful impact for users. I'm currently developing <b>Point Pilot</b>, a full-stack application that helps users strategize & optimize their credit rewards for maximum financial value!

When I'm not coding, I'm usually discovering new music 🎵, hunting for great food 🌮, or getting outdoors 🏕️.
